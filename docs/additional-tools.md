# Additional Tools

## Docker
### Install
Download and install Docker from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Open the application - it may prompt for password entry as it requires elevated permissions, if so enter password and run.

To check everything is running as it should, enter:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

If this returns a valid version and build, you are good to go.
